## Necropsy


![Rates of amyloid formation of necropsy samples. Plot is facetted by tissue type and dilution factor. Samples are denoted on the x-axis. Generally, for obex, a dilution factor of 10$^{-4}$ is considered standard. For RAMALT and RPLN, a dilution factor of 10$^{-3}$. At standard dilutions, Nano-QuIC generally out-performs RT-QuIC. Notably, for sample B-227, Nano-QuIC had positive seeding activity at 10$^{-2}$ whereas RT-QuIC did not. This animal was euthanized 3 months into the study.](figures/necropsy/light_RAFs.png)

![Density plots of rates of amyloid formation. For each sample type (obex, RAMALT, and RPLN), Nano-QuIC tends to have faster reaction kinetics.](figures/necropsy/light_histograms.png)
